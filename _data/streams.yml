      bio: Presenting our first senior onboard, the 'Chillax' Mangesh, a student from KV and later a 2017 batch DAV Bistupur passout. He's not just a hardworking and sincere student but also a very understanding and helpful friend. Was the Jamshedpur Aiims entrance exam topper. Cleared Jipmer and Neet exams, and chose to join AFMC. He's a chess and badminton player at zonal level, who never disappoints to encourage others with his equally balanced easy going and serious nature. Backed with such brilliant achievements we look forward to a happy Wiser-saathi experience both for Mangesh and students✨

    - name: Arka Basu
      ed: MBBS, AFMC Pune
      bio: Well, well! This is Arka, from AFMC and I may not know him in college, but at school, he was that one kid who'd be the center of all fun and masti, look careless(maybe he indeed was about Biotech marks) but at the end had the best marks in NEET. If teacher's at DAV Bistupur hate you, he's the best guy you can ask for ways to piss them more. But being serious, this guy's a gem, hardworking, dedicated and fun to hang around.Also he's a great musician.
